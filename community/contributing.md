# Contributing to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is initially designed and implemented by browser vendors who are
interested in meeting a variety of [use cases](/docs/use-cases/). As design and
implementation progresses they'll need input and contributions from developers
interested in using WebAssembly.

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Acquainting yourself with the
   [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct/).
2. Reading the [WebAssembly design][].
3. Joining the [Discord #cg chat](https://discord.gg/kx5VNQa).

With that background understood and communication set up, feel free to
[file issues][] in the WebAssembly design repository. Please join the
[W3C Community Group][] before sending pull requests: it provides the legal
framework that protects the work in this repository. Make sure you're affiliated
with your company or organization in the Community Group, if any.

As WebAssembly moves forward we expect to form an official standards body, which
will have its own contribution process to the specification.

Happy assembly!
