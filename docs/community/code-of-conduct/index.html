<p>WebAssembly operates under the W3C’s
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>W3C is a growing and global community where participants choose to work
together, and in that process experience differences in language, location,
nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings
and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In
rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one
or more people in the community, which W3C will not tolerate.</p>

  <p>A Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is useful to define accepted and
acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional
practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a
vehicle for better identity of the organization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We hope that our community group act according to these guidelines, and that
participants hold each other to these high standards. If you have any questions
or are worried that the code isn’t being followed, please contact the Community
Group’s chairs at <code class="highlighter-rouge">team-webassembly-chairs@w3.org</code> (note: this list is also
visible to W3C staff). For very serious concerns, the W3C has <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">procedures</a>
allowing you to access its ombuds directly and confidentially.</p>
