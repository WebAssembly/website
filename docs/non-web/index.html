<p>While WebAssembly is designed to run <a href="../web/">on the Web</a>, it is
also desirable for it to be able to execute well in other environments,
including everything from minimal shells for testing to full-blown
application environments e.g. on servers in datacenters, on IoT devices,
or mobile/desktop apps. It may even be desirable to execute WebAssembly
embedded within larger programs.</p>

<p>Non-Web environments may provide different APIs than Web
environments, which
<a href="../feature-test/">feature testing</a> and
<a href="../dynamic-linking/">dynamic linking</a> will make discoverable and
usable.</p>

<p>Non-Web environments may include JavaScript VMs (e.g. <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>), however
WebAssembly is also being designed to be capable of being executed without a
JavaScript VM present.</p>

<p>The WebAssembly spec itself will not try to define any large portable libc-like
library. However, certain features that are core to WebAssembly semantics that
are similar to functions found in native libc <em>would</em> be part of the core
WebAssembly spec as primitive operators (e.g., the <code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> operator, which
is similar to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbrk</code> function on many systems, and in the future, operators
similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dlopen</code>).</p>

<p>Where there is overlap between the Web and popular non-Web environments,
shared specs could be proposed, but these would be separate from the WebAssembly
spec. A symmetric example in JavaScript would be the in-progress 
<a href="https://whatwg.github.io/loader">Loader</a> spec, which is proposed for both
Web and node.js environments and is distinct from the JavaScript spec.</p>

<p>However, for most cases it is expected that, to achieve portability at the
source code level, communities would build libraries that mapped from a 
source-level interface to the host environment’s builtin capabilities
(either at build time or runtime).  WebAssembly would provide the raw building
blocks (feature testing, <a href="../modules/#imports-and-exports">builtin modules</a> and
dynamic loading) to make these libraries possible. Two early expected examples
are POSIX and SDL.</p>

<p>In general, by keeping the non-Web path such that it doesn’t require
Web APIs, WebAssembly could be used as a portable binary format on many
platforms, bringing great benefits in portability, tooling and
language-agnosticity (since it supports C/C++ level semantics).</p>
