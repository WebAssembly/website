<p>While WebAssembly is designed to run <a href="../web/">on the Web</a>, it is
also desirable for it to be able to execute well in other environments,
including everything from minimal shells for testing to full-blown
application environments e.g. on servers in datacenters, on IoT devices,
or mobile/desktop apps. It may even be desirable to execute WebAssembly
embedded within larger programs.</p>

<p>Non-Web environments may provide different APIs than Web
environments.</p>

<p>Non-Web environments include JavaScript VMs (e.g. <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a>), however
WebAssembly is also capable of being executed without a JavaScript VM present.
The table in the <a href="https://webassembly.org/features/">features page</a> of the website lists several such
implementations.</p>

<p><a href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a> is a set of standards-track APIs being developed by the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi">WASI Subgroup</a>
intended for use in many environments, including in non-browser and non-JS
engines.</p>

<p>The WebAssembly spec itself will not try to define any large portable libc-like
library. However, certain features that are core to WebAssembly semantics that
are similar to functions found in native libc <em>would</em> be part of the core
WebAssembly spec as primitive operators (e.g., the <code class="highlighter-rouge">memory.grow</code> operator, which
is similar to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbrk</code> function on many systems, and in the future, perhaps
operators supporting <code class="highlighter-rouge">dlopen</code> functionality).</p>

<p>Where there is overlap between the Web and popular non-Web environments,
shared specs could be proposed, but these would be separate from the WebAssembly
spec. A symmetric example in JavaScript would be the in-progress 
<a href="https://whatwg.github.io/loader">Loader</a> spec, which is proposed for both
Web and node.js environments and is distinct from the JavaScript spec.</p>

<p>However, for most cases it is expected that, to achieve portability at the
source code level, communities would build libraries that mapped from a 
source-level interface such as POSIX or SDL to the host environment’s builtin
capabilities, either at build time or runtime, possibly making use of
<a href="../feature-test/">feature testing</a>, <a href="../dynamic-linking/">dynamic linking</a>,
static linking, or polyfilling.</p>

<p>In general, by preserving spec layering, and the core WebAssembly spec
independent of the host environment and linking specs, WebAssembly can be
used as a portable binary format on many platforms, in many environments, for
many use cases, bringing great benefits in portability, tooling and
language-agnosticity.</p>
