<p>This document explains the high-level design of WebAssembly code: its types, constructs, and
semantics.
WebAssembly code can be considered a <em>structured stack machine</em>; a machine where most computations use a stack
of values, but control flow is expressed in structured constructs such as blocks, ifs, and loops.
In practice, implementations need not maintain an actual value stack, nor actual data structures for control; they
need only behave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-if_rule">as if</a> they did so.
For full details consult <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec">the formal Specification</a>,
for file-level encoding details consult <a href="../binary-encoding/">Binary Encoding</a>,
and for the human-readable text representation consult <a href="../text-format/">Text Format</a>.</p>

<p>Each function body consists of a list of instructions which forms an implicit <em>block</em>.
Execution of instructions proceeds by way of a traditional <em>program counter</em> that advances
through the instructions.
Instructions fall into two categories: <em>control</em> instructions that form control constructs and <em>simple</em> instructions.
Control instructions pop their argument value(s) off the stack, may change the
program counter, and push result value(s) onto the stack.
Simple instructions pop their argument value(s) from the stack, apply an operator to the values,
and then push the result value(s) onto the stack, followed by an implicit advancement of
the program counter.</p>

<p>All instructions and operators in WebAssembly are explicitly typed, with no overloading rules.
Verification of WebAssembly code requires only a single pass with constant-time
type checking and well-formedness checking.</p>

<p>WebAssembly offers a set of language-independent operators that closely
match operators in many programming languages and are efficiently implementable
on all modern computers. Each operator has a corresponding simple instruction.</p>

<p>The <a href="../rationale/">rationale</a> document details why WebAssembly is designed as
detailed in this document.</p>

<p><a href="../future-features/"><img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a> = Planned <a href="../future-features/">future</a> feature</p>

<h2 id="traps">Traps</h2>

<p>Some operators may <em>trap</em> under some conditions, as noted below. In the MVP,
trapping means that execution in the WebAssembly instance is terminated and
abnormal termination is reported to the outside environment. In a JavaScript
environment such as a browser, a trap results in throwing a JavaScript exception.
If developer tools are active, attaching a debugger before the
termination would be sensible.</p>

<p>Call stack space is limited by unspecified and dynamically varying constraints
and is a source of <a href="../nondeterminism/">nondeterminism</a>. If program call stack usage
exceeds the available call stack space at any time, a trap occurs.</p>

<p>Implementations must have an internal maximum call stack size, and every call
must take up some resources toward exhausting that size (of course, dynamic
resources may be exhausted much earlier). This rule exists to avoid differences
in observable behavior; if some implementations have this property and others
don’t, the same program which runs successfully on some implementations may
consume unbounded resources and fail on others. Also, in the future, it is
expected that WebAssembly will add some form of stack-introspection
functionality, in which case such optimizations would be directly observable.</p>

<p>Support for explicit tail calls is planned in
<a href="../future-features/#general-purpose-proper-tail-calls">the future <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a>,
which would add an explicit tail-call operator with well-defined effects
on stack introspection.</p>

<h2 id="types">Types</h2>

<p>WebAssembly has the following <em>value types</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code>: 32-bit integer</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64</code>: 64-bit integer</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f32</code>: 32-bit floating point</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f64</code>: 64-bit floating point</li>
</ul>

<p>Each parameter and local variable has exactly one <a href="../semantics/#types">value type</a>. Function signatures
consist of a sequence of zero or more parameter types and a sequence of zero or more return
types. (Note: in the MVP, a function can have at most one return type).</p>

<p>Note that the value types <code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i64</code> are not inherently signed or
unsigned. The interpretation of these types is determined by individual
operators.</p>

<h2 id="linear-memory">Linear Memory</h2>

<p>A <em>linear memory</em> is a contiguous, byte-addressable range of memory spanning
from offset <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> and extending up to a varying <em>memory size</em>. This size is always 
a multiple of the WebAssembly page size, which is fixed to 64KiB (though large
page support may be added in an opt-in manner in the 
<a href="../future-features/#large-page-support">future</a>). The initial state of a linear
memory is defined by the module’s <a href="../modules/#linear-memory-section">linear memory</a> and
<a href="../modules/#data-section">data</a> sections. The memory size can be dynamically
increased by the <a href="../semantics/#resizing"><code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code></a> operator.</p>

<p>A linear memory can be considered to be an untyped array of bytes, and it is
unspecified how embedders map this array into their process’ own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual
memory</a>. Linear memory is sandboxed; it does not alias other linear memories,
the execution engine’s internal data structures, the execution stack, local
variables, or other process memory.</p>

<p>Every WebAssembly <a href="../modules/">instance</a> has one specially-designated <em>default</em> 
linear memory which is the linear memory accessed by all the 
<a href="#linear-memory-access">memory operators below</a>. In the MVP, there are <em>only</em>
default linear memories but
<a href="../future-features/#multiple-tables-and-memories">new memory operators <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a>
may be added after the MVP which can also access non-default memories.</p>

<p>Linear memories (default or otherwise) can either be <a href="../modules/#imports">imported</a>
or <a href="../modules/#linear-memory-section">defined inside the module</a>. After import
or definition, there is no difference when accessing a linear memory whether it
was imported or defined internally.</p>

<p>In the MVP, linear memory cannot be shared between threads of execution.
The addition of <a href="../future-features/#threads">threads <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a> will allow this.</p>

<h3 id="linear-memory-accesses">Linear Memory Accesses</h3>

<p>Linear memory access is accomplished with explicit <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code> operators.
All <code class="highlighter-rouge">load</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">store</code> operators use little-endian byte order when translating
between values and bytes.
Integer loads can specify a <em>storage size</em> which is smaller than the result type as
well as a signedness which determines whether the bytes are sign- or zero-
extended into the result type.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.load8_s</code>: load 1 byte and sign-extend i8 to i32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.load8_u</code>: load 1 byte and zero-extend i8 to i32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.load16_s</code>: load 2 bytes and sign-extend i16 to i32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.load16_u</code>: load 2 bytes and zero-extend i16 to i32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.load</code>: load 4 bytes as i32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load8_s</code>: load 1 byte and sign-extend i8 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load8_u</code>: load 1 byte and zero-extend i8 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load16_s</code>: load 2 bytes and sign-extend i16 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load16_u</code>: load 2 bytes and zero-extend i16 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load32_s</code>: load 4 bytes and sign-extend i32 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load32_u</code>: load 4 bytes and zero-extend i32 to i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.load</code>: load 8 bytes as i64</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f32.load</code>: load 4 bytes as f32</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f64.load</code>: load 8 bytes as f64</li>
</ul>

<p>Stores have an additional input operand which is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">value</code> to store to memory.
Like loads, integer stores may specify a smaller <em>storage size</em> than the operand
size in which case integer wrapping is implied.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.store8</code>: wrap i32 to i8 and store 1 byte</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.store16</code>: wrap i32 to i16 and store 2 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.store</code>: (no conversion) store 4 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.store8</code>: wrap i64 to i8 and store 1 byte</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.store16</code>: wrap i64 to i16 and store 2 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.store32</code>: wrap i64 to i32 and store 4 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.store</code>: (no conversion) store 8 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f32.store</code>: (no conversion) store 4 bytes</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f64.store</code>: (no conversion) store 8 bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>Store operators do not produce a value.</p>

<p>The above operators operate on the <a href="#linear-memory">default linear memory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="addressing">Addressing</h3>

<p>Each linear memory access operator has an address operand and an unsigned
integer byte offset immediate. The infinite-precision unsigned sum of the
address operand’s value with the offset’s value is called the <em>effective
address</em>, which is interpreted as an unsigned byte index into the linear memory.</p>

<p>Linear memory operators access the bytes starting at the effective address and
extend for the number of bytes implied by the storage size. If any of the
accessed bytes are beyond the current memory size, the access is considered
<em>out-of-bounds</em>.</p>

<p>The use of infinite-precision in the effective address computation means that
the addition of the offset to the address never causes wrapping, so if the
address for an access is out-of-bounds, the effective address will always also
be out-of-bounds.</p>

<p>In wasm32, address operands and offset attributes have type <code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code>, and linear
memory sizes are limited to 4 GiB (of course, actual sizes are further limited
by <a href="../nondeterminism/">available resources</a>). In wasm64, address operands and
offsets have type <code class="highlighter-rouge">i64</code>. The MVP only includes wasm32; subsequent versions
will add support for wasm64 and thus
<a href="../future-features/#linear-memory-bigger-than-4-gib">&gt;4 GiB linear memory <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a>.</p>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>Each linear memory access operator also has an immediate positive integer power
of 2 alignment attribute which must be no greater than the memory access’ size.
An alignment value which is the same as the memory access’ size is considered
to be a <em>natural</em> alignment. The alignment applies to the effective address and
not merely the address operand, i.e. the immediate offset is taken into account
when considering alignment.</p>

<p>The alignment has same type (determined by wasm32/wasm64, as described above) as
the address and offset operands.</p>

<p>If the effective address of a memory access is a multiple of the alignment
attribute value of the memory access, the memory access is considered <em>aligned</em>,
otherwise it is considered <em>misaligned</em>. Aligned and misaligned accesses have
the same behavior.</p>

<p>Alignment affects performance as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aligned accesses with at least natural alignment are fast.</li>
  <li>Aligned accesses with less than natural alignment may be somewhat slower
(think: implementation makes multiple accesses, either in software or in
hardware).</li>
  <li>Misaligned access of any kind may be <em>massively</em> slower (think:
implementation takes a signal and fixes things up).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, it is recommend that WebAssembly producers align frequently-used data to
permit the use of natural alignment access, and use loads and stores with the
greatest alignment values practical, while always avoiding misaligned accesses.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-bounds">Out of Bounds</h3>

<p>Out of bounds accesses trap.</p>

<h3 id="resizing">Resizing</h3>

<p>In the MVP, linear memory can be resized by a <code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> operator. The
operand to this operator is in units of the WebAssembly page size,
which is defined to be 64KiB (though large page support may be added in 
the <a href="../future-features/#large-page-support">future <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> : grow linear memory by a given unsigned delta of pages.
 Return the previous memory size in units of pages or -1 on failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a linear memory has a declared <a href="../modules/#linear-memory-section">maximum memory size</a>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> must fail if it would grow past the maximum. However,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> may still fail before the maximum if it was not possible to
reserve the space up front or if enabling the reserved memory fails.
When there is no maximum memory size declared, <code class="highlighter-rouge">grow_memory</code> is expected
to perform a system allocation which may fail.</p>

<p>The current size of the linear memory can be queried by the following operator:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">current_memory</code> : return the current memory size in units of pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>As stated <a href="../semantics/#linear-memory">above</a>, linear memory is contiguous,
meaning there are no “holes” in the linear address space. After the
MVP, there are <a href="../future-features/#finer-grained-control-over-memory">future features <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a>
proposed to allow setting protection and creating mappings within the
contiguous linear memory.</p>

<p>In the MVP, memory can only be grown. After the MVP, a memory shrinking
operator may be added. However, due to normal fragmentation, applications are
instead expected release unused physical pages from the working set using the
<a href="../future-features/#finer-grained-control-over-memory"><code class="highlighter-rouge">discard</code> <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a> future feature.</p>

<p>The above operators operate on the <a href="#linear-memory">default linear memory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="table">Table</h2>

<p>A <em>table</em> is similar to a linear memory whose elements, instead of being bytes,
are opaque values of a particular <em>table element type</em>. This allows the table to
contain values—like GC references, raw OS handles, or native pointers—that are
accessed by WebAssembly code indirectly through an integer index. This feature
bridges the gap between low-level, untrusted linear memory and high-level
opaque handles/references at the cost of a bounds-checked table indirection.</p>

<p>The table’s element type constrains the type of elements stored in the table
and allows engines to avoid some type checks on table use. When a WebAssembly
value is stored in a table, the value’s type must precisely match the element
type. Depending on the operator/API used to store the value, this check may be
static or dynamic. Just like linear memory, updates to a table are observed
immediately by all instances that reference the table. Host environments may
also allow storing non-WebAssembly values in tables in which case, as with
<a href="../modules/#imports">imports</a>, the meaning of using the value is defined by the
host environment.</p>

<p>Every WebAssembly <a href="../modules/">instance</a> has one specially-designated <em>default</em>
table which is indexed by <a href="#calls"><code class="highlighter-rouge">call_indirect</code></a> and other future
table operators. Tables can either be <a href="../modules/#imports">imported</a> or 
<a href="../modules/#table-section">defined inside the module</a>. After import or
definition, there is no difference when calling into a table whether it was
imported or defined internally.</p>

<p>In the MVP, the primary purpose of tables is to implement indirect function
calls in C/C++ using an integer index as the pointer-to-function and the table
to hold the array of indirectly-callable functions. Thus, in the MVP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tables may only be accessed from WebAssembly code via <a href="#calls"><code class="highlighter-rouge">call_indirect</code></a>;</li>
  <li>the only allowed table element type is <code class="highlighter-rouge">anyfunc</code> (function with any signature);</li>
  <li>tables may not be directly mutated or resized from WebAssembly code;
this can only be done through the host environment (e.g., the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WebAssembly</code>
<a href="../js/#webassemblytable-objects">JavaScript API</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>These restrictions may be relaxed in the [future <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">][types].</p>

<h2 id="local-variables">Local variables</h2>

<p>Each function has a fixed, pre-declared number of <em>local variables</em> which occupy a single
index space local to the function. Parameters are addressed as local variables. Local
variables do not have addresses and are not aliased by linear memory. Local
variables have <a href="#types">value types</a> and are initialized to the appropriate zero value for their
type at the beginning of the function, except parameters which are initialized to the values
of the arguments passed to the function.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">get_local</code>: read the current value of a local variable</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">set_local</code>: set the current value of a local variable</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tee_local</code>: like <code class="highlighter-rouge">set_local</code>, but also returns the set value</li>
</ul>

<p>The details of index space for local variables and their types will be further clarified,
e.g. whether locals with type <code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i64</code> must be contiguous and separate from
others, etc.</p>

<h2 id="global-variables">Global variables</h2>

<p>A <em>global variable</em> stores a single value of a fixed <a href="#types">value type</a> and may be
declared either <em>mutable</em> or <em>immutable</em>. This provides WebAssembly with memory
locations that are disjoint from any <a href="#linear-memory">linear memory</a> and thus
cannot be arbitrarily aliased as bits.</p>

<p>Global variables are accessed via an integer index into the module-defined 
<a href="../modules/#global-index-space">global index space</a>. Global variables can 
either be <a href="../modules/#imports">imported</a> or <a href="../modules/#global-section">defined inside the module</a>.
After import or definition, there is no difference when accessing a global.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">get_global</code>: get the current value of a global variable</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">set_global</code>: set the current value of a global variable</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a validation error for a <code class="highlighter-rouge">set_global</code> to index an immutable global variable.</p>

<p>In the MVP, the primary use case of global variables is to represent
instantiation-time immutable values as a useful building block for
<a href="../dynamic-linking/">dynamic linking</a>.</p>

<p>After the MVP, when <a href="../gc/">reference types</a> are added to the set of <a href="#types">value types</a>,
global variables will be necessary to allow sharing reference types between
<a href="../future-features/#threads">threads <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle"></a> since shared linear memory cannot load or store
references.</p>

<h2 id="control-constructs-and-instructions">Control constructs and instructions</h2>

<p>WebAssembly offers basic structured control flow constructs such as <em>blocks</em>, <em>loops</em>, and <em>ifs</em>.
All constructs are formed out of the following control instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">nop</code>: no operation, no effect</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>: the beginning of a block construct, a sequence of instructions with a label at the end</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code>: a block with a label at the beginning which may be used to form loops</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>: the beginning of an if construct with an implicit <em>then</em> block</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code>: marks the else block of an if</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">br</code>: branch to a given label in an enclosing construct</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">br_if</code>: conditionally branch to a given label in an enclosing construct</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">br_table</code>: a jump table which jumps to a label in an enclosing construct</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code>: return zero or more values from this function</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code>: an instruction that marks the end of a block, loop, if, or function</li>
</ul>

<p>Blocks are composed of matched pairs of <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code> … <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> instructions, loops with matched pairs of 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> … <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> instructions, and ifs with either <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> … <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> … <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> … <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> sequences.
For each of these constructs the instructions in the ellipsis are said to be <em>enclosed</em> in the
construct.</p>

<h3 id="branches-and-nesting">Branches and nesting</h3>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">br</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">br_if</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">br_table</code> instructions express low-level branching and are hereafter refered to simply as branches.
Branches may only reference labels defined by a construct in which they are enclosed.
For example, references to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>’s label can only occur within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>’s body.</p>

<p>In practice, outer <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>s can be used to place labels for any given branching
pattern, except that the nesting restriction makes it impossible to branch into the middle of a loop
from outside the loop. This limitation ensures by construction that all control flow graphs
are well-structured as in high-level languages like Java, JavaScript and Go.
Notice that that a branch to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>’s label is  equivalent to a labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">break</code> in
high-level languages; branches simply break out of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code>, and branches to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code>
correspond to a “continue” statement.</p>

<h3 id="execution-semantics-of-control-instructions">Execution semantics of control instructions</h3>

<p>Executing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> pops return value(s) off the stack and returns from the current function.</p>

<p>Executing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> instruction has no effect on the value stack.</p>

<p>Executing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> (including implicit blocks such as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> or for a function body) has no effect on the value stack.</p>

<p>Executing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> of the implicit block for a function body pops the return value(s) (if any) off the stack and returns from the function.</p>

<p>Executing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> instruction pops an <code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code> condition off the stack and either falls through to the next instruction
or sets the program counter to after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>.</p>

<p>Executing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">else</code> instruction of an <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> sets the program counter to after the corresponding <code class="highlighter-rouge">end</code> of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code>.</p>

<p>Branches that exit a <code class="highlighter-rouge">block</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> may yield value(s) for that construct.
Branches pop result value(s) off the stack which must be the same type as the declared
type of the construct which they target. If a conditional or unconditional branch is taken, the values pushed
onto the stack between the beginning of the construct and the branch are discarded, the result value(s) are
pushed back onto the stack, and the program counter is updated to the end of the construct.</p>

<p>Branches that target a <code class="highlighter-rouge">loop</code> do not yield a value; they pop any values pushed onto the stack since the start of the loop and set the program counter to the start of the loop.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">drop</code> operator can be used to explicitly pop and a value from the stack.</p>

<p>The implicit popping associated with explicit branches makes compiling expression languages straightforward, even non-local
control-flow transfer, requiring fewer drops.</p>

<p>Note that in the MVP, all control constructs and control instructions, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> are
restricted to at most one value.</p>

<h3 id="br_table"><code class="highlighter-rouge">br_table</code></h3>

<p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">br_table</code> consists of a zero-based array of labels, a <em>default</em> label,
and an index operand. A <code class="highlighter-rouge">br_table</code> jumps to the label indexed in the array
or the default label if the index is out of bounds.</p>

<h2 id="calls">Calls</h2>

<p>Each function has a <em>signature</em>, which consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Return types, which are a sequence of value types</li>
  <li>Argument types, which are a sequence of value types</li>
</ul>

<p>WebAssembly doesn’t support variable-length argument lists (aka
varargs). Compilers targeting WebAssembly can instead support them through
explicit accesses to linear memory.</p>

<p>In the MVP, the length of the return types sequence may only be 0 or 1. This
restriction may be lifted in the future.</p>

<p>Direct calls to a function specify the callee by an index into the 
<a href="../modules/#function-index-space">function index space</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">call</code>: call function directly</li>
</ul>

<p>A direct call to a function with a mismatched signature is a module verification error.</p>

<p>Indirect calls to a function indicate the callee with an <code class="highlighter-rouge">i32</code> index into
a <a href="#table">table</a>. The <em>expected</em> signature of the target function (specified
by its index in the <a href="../binary-encoding/#type-section">types section</a>) is given as
a second immediate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">call_indirect</code>: call function indirectly</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike <code class="highlighter-rouge">call</code>, which checks that the caller and callee signatures match
statically as part of validation, <code class="highlighter-rouge">call_indirect</code> checks for signature match
<em>dynamically</em>, comparing the caller’s expected signature with the callee function’s
signature and and trapping if there is a mismatch. Since the callee may be in a
different module which necessarily has a separate <a href="../binary-encoding/#type-section">types section</a>,
and thus index space of types, the signature match must compare the underlying 
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/interpreter/spec/types.ml#L5"><code class="highlighter-rouge">func_type</code></a>.
As noted <a href="#table">above</a>, table elements may also be host-environment-defined
values in which case the meaning of a call (and how the signature is checked)
is defined by the host-environment, much like calling an import.</p>

<p>In the MVP, the single <code class="highlighter-rouge">call_indirect</code> operator accesses the <a href="#table">default table</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple return value calls will be possible, though possibly not in the
MVP. The details of multiple-return-value calls needs clarification. Calling a
function that returns multiple values will likely have to be a statement that
specifies multiple local variables to which to assign the corresponding return
values.</p>

<h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>

<p>These operators have an immediate operand of their associated type which is
produced as their result value. All possible values of all types are
supported (including NaN values of all possible bit patterns).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.const</code>: produce the value of an i32 immediate</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i64.const</code>: produce the value of an i64 immediate</li>

  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f64.const</code>: produce the value of an f64 immediate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32-bit-integer-operators">32-bit Integer operators</h2>

<p>Integer operators are signed, unsigned, or sign-agnostic. Signed operators
use two’s complement signed integer representation.</p>

<p>Signed and unsigned operators trap whenever the result cannot be represented
in the result type. This includes division and remainder by zero, and signed
division overflow (<code class="highlighter-rouge">INT32_MIN / -1</code>). Signed remainder with a non-zero
denominator always returns the correct value, even when the corresponding
division would trap. Sign-agnostic operators silently wrap overflowing
results into the result type.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.add</code>: sign-agnostic addition</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.sub</code>: sign-agnostic subtraction</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.mul</code>: sign-agnostic multiplication (lower 32-bits)</li>

  <li>

<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.ge_u</code>: unsigned greater than or equal</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.clz</code>: sign-agnostic count leading zero bits (All zero bits are considered leading if the value is zero)</li>

  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.popcnt</code>: sign-agnostic count number of one bits</li>
  <li>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">i32.eqz</code>: compare equal to zero (return 1 if operand is zero, 0 otherwise)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shifts counts are wrapped to be less than the log-base-2 of the number of bits
in the value to be shifted, as an unsigned quantity. For example, in a 32-bit
shift, only the least 5 significant bits of the count affect the result. In a
64-bit shift, only the least 6 significant bits of the count affect the result.</p>

<p>Rotate counts are treated as unsigned.  A count value greater than or equal
to the number of bits in the value to be rotated yields the same result as
if the count was wrapped to its least significant N bits, where N is 5 for
an i32 value or 6 for an i64 value.</p>

<p>All comparison operators yield 32-bit integer results with <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> representing
<code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code> representing <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

<h2 id="64-bit-integer-operators">64-bit integer operators</h2>

<p>The same operators are available on 64-bit integers as the those available for
32-bit integers.</p>

<h2 id="floating-point-operators">Floating point operators</h2>

<p>Floating point arithmetic follows the IEEE 754-2008 standard, except that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IEEE 754-2008 section 6.2 recommendation that operations propagate NaN
bits from their operands is permitted but not required.</li>
  <li>WebAssembly uses “non-stop” mode, and floating point exceptions are not
otherwise observable. In particular, neither alternate floating point
exception handling attributes nor the non-computational operators on status
flags are supported. There is no observable difference between quiet and
signalling NaN. However, positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN are
still always produced as result values to indicate overflow, invalid, and
divide-by-zero conditions, as specified by IEEE 754-2008.</li>
  <li>WebAssembly uses the round-to-nearest ties-to-even rounding attribute, except
where otherwise specified. Non-default directed rounding attributes are not
supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, these limitations may be lifted, enabling
[full IEEE 754-2008 support <img class="emoji" title=":unicorn:" alt=":unicorn:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f984.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">][future ieee 745].</p>

<p>Note that not all operators required by IEEE 754-2008 are provided directly.
However, WebAssembly includes enough functionality to support reasonable library
implementations of the remaining required operators.</p>

<p>When the result of any arithmetic operation other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">neg</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">abs</code>, or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">copysign</code> is a NaN, the sign bit and the fraction field (which does not include
the implicit leading digit of the significand) of the NaN are computed as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the fraction fields of all NaN inputs to the instruction all consist
of 1 in the most significant bit and 0 in the remaining bits, or if there are
no NaN inputs, the result is a NaN with a nondeterministic sign bit, 1 in the
most significant bit of the fraction field, and all zeros in the remaining
bits of the fraction field.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Otherwise the result is a NaN with a nondeterministic sign bit, 1 in the most
significant bit of the fraction field, and nondeterminsitic values in the
remaining bits of the fraction field.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
