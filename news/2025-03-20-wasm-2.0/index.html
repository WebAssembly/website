<p><em>Published on March 20, 2025 by
<a href="https://github.com/rossberg">Andreas Rossberg</a>.</em></p>

<p>As of last December, release 2.0 of the Wasm specification is “official”!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/wasm2_0.png" alt="Screenshot of W3C site" /></p>

<p>If you have been following the developments of the Wasm standard, then version
2.0 may sound like rather old news to you. And indeed, the Wasm Community and
Working Groups had reached consensus and finished the specification in
early 2022. All major implementations have been shipping 2.0 for even longer.
But for a variety of non-technical reasons, it took a while for it to advance
through the W3C process and reach the status of “Candidate Recommendation”.</p>

<p>With the advent of 2.0, the Working Group is switching to a so-called
“evergreen” model for future releases. That means that the Candidate
Recommendation will be updated in place when we create new versions of the
language, without ever technically moving it to the final Recommendation state.
For all intents and purposes, the latest
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-2/">Candidate Recommendation Draft</a> is
considered to be the current standard, representing the consensus of the
Community Group and Working Group. (If this sounds odd, that’s mostly because
the W3C’s document terminology does not quite match this more flexible process,
which has recently been adopted by several working groups.)</p>

<p>For the most up-to-date version of the current specification, we recommend
looking at the documents hosted on our
<a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/">GitHub page</a>. This always includes the
latest fixes and offers multiple different formats for reading and browsing.</p>

<p>For those who are not following the evolution of Wasm as closely, here is the
summary of the additions in version 2.0 of the language:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/webassembly/simd"><em>Vector instructions</em></a>: With a massive
236 new instructions — more than the total number Wasm had before — it now
supports 128-bit wide SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) functionality
of contemporary CPUs, like Intel’s SSE or ARM’s SVE. This helps speeding up
certain classes of compute-intense applications like audio/video codecs,
machine learning, and some cryptography.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="simd"></wasm-compat>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations"><em>Bulk memory instructions</em></a>:
A set of new instructions allows faster copying and initialization of regions
of memory or ranges of tables.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="bulkMemory"></wasm-compat>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/multi-value"><em>Multi-value results</em></a>:
Instructions, blocks, and functions can now return more than one result value,
sometimes supporting faster calling conventions and avoiding indirections. In
addition, block instructions now also can have inputs, enabling new program
transformations.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="multiValue"></wasm-compat>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types"><em>Reference types</em></a>:
References to functions or pointers to external objects (e.g., JavaScript
values) become available as opaque first-class values. Tables are repurposed
as a general storage for such reference values, and new instructions allow
accessing and mutating tables in Wasm code. In addition, modules now may
define multiple tables of different types.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="referenceTypes"></wasm-compat>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/nontrapping-float-to-int-conversions"><em>Non-trapping conversions</em></a>:
Additional instructions allow the conversion from float to integer types
without the risk of trapping unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="saturatedFloatToInt"></wasm-compat>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/sign-extension-ops"><em>Sign extension instructions</em></a>:
A new group of instructions allows directly extending the width of signed
integer value. Previously that was only possible when reading from memory.</li>
</ul>

<wasm-compat hide-header="" wasm-feature="signExtensions"></wasm-compat>

<p>It goes without saying that Wasm 2.0 is fully backwards-compatible with 1.0,
that is, every valid program remains valid and preserves its behaviour.</p>

<p>In a future post we will take a look at Wasm 3.0, which is already around the
corner at this point!</p>
