# Specifications

- [Core specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/): defines the semantics of WebAssembly modules independent from a concrete embedding. The WebAssembly core is specified in a single document.
- Embedding interfaces:
  - [JavaScript API](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/index.html): defines JavaScript classes and objects for accessing WebAssembly from within JavaScript, including methods for validation, compilation, instantiation, and classes for representing and manipulating imports and exports as JavaScript objects.
  - [Web API](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/web-api/index.html): defines extensions to the JavaScript API made available specifically in web browsers, in particular, an interface for streaming compilation and instantiation from origin-bound `Response` types.
  - [WASI API](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/master/phases/snapshot/docs.md): defines a modular system interface to run WebAssembly outside the web, providing access to things like files, network connections, clocks, and random numbers.
- [Tool conventions](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions): repository describing non-standard conventions useful for coordinating interoperability between tools working with WebAssembly. This includes conventions for linking schemes, debugging information, language ABIs and more.
- [Original design documents](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design): documents describing the design, goals and high-level overview of WebAssembly. Some of these documents are outdated by now.
